/*You are given an array A with size N (indexed from 0) and an integer K. Let's define another array B with size N · K as the array that's formed by concatenating K copies of array A.

For example, if A = {1, 2} and K = 3, then B = {1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2}.

You have to find the maximum subarray sum of the array B. Fomally, you should compute the maximum value of Bi + Bi+1 + Bi+2 + ... + Bj, where 0 ≤ i ≤ j < N · K.*/
